% hBS_Munc13_noBatch_v2.m: hBS of Kaeser lab data, omitting batch

% RTB wrote it, 29 September 2022, plane ride to MKE, mom's hip surgery

% Adapted from hBS_Munc13_v2.m
%
% In this version, we'll pool all of the cells from a given batch and
% resample from cells and sweeps only. The motivation for this is:
%   1. Resampling from n = 3 batches is probably not legit
%   2. The ICC for batches tends to be low.

% When the Kaeser lab knocks out two genes involved in synaptic
% release (RIMs & ELKS), synaptic transmission is reduced by about 80%. Now
% they want to ask whether KO'ing a 3rd gene, Munc13, further reduces
% synaptic transmission. However, since the double KO (RIMs/ELKS) is in a
% different mouse strain from the triple KO (RIMs/ELKS/Munc13), the
% synaptic transmission in each strain's KO must be compared to its own
% control.
%
% S_1 = Strain 1: RIMs/ELKS-Cre
% S_2 = Strain 2: RIMs/ELKS/Munc13-Cre
%
% To perform an experiment in a given strain, several mice are killed, the
% hippocampi (HC) are dissected, cells dissociated and pooled together in
% one big primary culture. This culture is then divided into two groups:
% one is treated with a lentivirus containing Cre (= KO); the other is
% treated with a lentivirus containing a dead Cre, 'delta-Cre' (= Control).
% From each culture, multiple cells are tested. Each cell is patch clamped
% and synaptic transmission is tested by measuring the size of the
% post-synaptic current (EPSC) evoked by an action potential. This
% measurment is generally repeated 5 times for each cell.
%
% C_1 = Condition 1: KO
% C_2 = Condition 2: Control
%
% Thus each group of 5 related measurements is uniquely identified by FOUR
% numbers, which will be variables (columns) in the Excel file. The Excel
% file will be read in as a Table variable, 'ds':
%
% ds.Strain [1:2]
% ds.Cond [1:2]
% ds.Batch [1:nBatches], may vary for different experiments
% ds.Cell [1:nCells], may vary for different batches
%
% For ease of discussion, we'll think of four groups:
%
% Group A: S_1, C_1 (RIMS/ELKS KO)
% Group B: S_1, C_2 (RIMS/ELKS Control)
% Group C: S_2, C_1 (RIMS/ELKS/Munc13 KO)
% Group D: S_2, C_2 (RIMS/ELKS/Munc13 Control)
%
% The scientific question is whether knocking out Munc13 (triple mutant,
% S2) causes a greater relative decrease in synaptic transmission as
% compared to the double mutant (S1). So we will define our test statistic,
% T, as:
%
% T = (mean(Group_A) / mean(Group_B)) / . . . 
%     (mean(Group_C) / mean(Group_D)) 
%
% The null value for this statistic is 1; our alternate hypothesis is:
%       T > 1

%% Hierarchical bootstrap

% For each group, we first resample (with replacement) from the batches.
% Then, for each of these batches, we resample from the cells; then for
% each cell we resample from the (usually 5) technical replicates. For the
% "sucrose" experiments, there is only one data point per cell.

% Many 'for' loops, and a lot of subsetting of the data (which can probably
% be avoided with more thought), so this might be kinda slow. Let's time it
% for different values of nBoot
tic;

% For nBoot = 100,000, run time 
% For nBoot = 10,000 the run time was around 3.5 min.
% For nBoot = 1,000, run time is 22 seconds
% For nBoot = 100, run time is about 2 seconds

nConds = 2;     % C_1 = KO, C_2 = control
